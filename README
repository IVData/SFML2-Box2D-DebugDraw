This is a debug rendering class for drawing debug Box2D info on an SFML window.
This code is an SFML2-compatible (as of 07/09/2012) version of the original class written by Allen Jordan, and Xabier Larrakoetxea.
The original version can be found here:

	https://github.com/slok/Box2D-and-SFML-demo

The original was released under the GPL, and as such, so is this version.
